## 📋 Project Overview

This School Management System is a comprehensive Node.js/Express backend solution designed for modern educational institutions. At its core, it implements a multi-tenant architecture supporting multiple campuses, each with its own administrators, teachers, and students. The system handles the complete academic lifecycle, from student enrollment and class management to examination scheduling and result processing.

The application is built with a strong emphasis on security, featuring JWT-based authentication with role-specific access control (Super Admin, Campus Admin, Teacher, Student). It includes sophisticated modules for attendance tracking (both students and teachers), comprehensive examination management, and automated marksheet generation with PDF export capabilities. The system also leverages AI through OpenRouter integration for generating personalized study recommendations based on student performance.

Key technical features include automated report generation through cron jobs, email notifications via Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP), and extensive data export options in both PDF and CSV formats. The system employs MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for flexible data modeling, implements thorough request validation using Joi, and includes comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms. Notable features include bulk operations for marksheet generation with ZIP support, configurable dashboard analytics, and a well-structured API supporting future scaling to mobile applications and frontend integrations.

This project already includes many of the building blocks listed below. The sections summarize what's implemented and what you can enable or extend easily.

- Node-cron (scheduled jobs)
   - Purpose: automate monthly attendance report generation and weekly low-attendance checks.
   - Location: `cronJobs/cronJobs.js` calls `services/reportService.js`.
   - Notes: Cron schedule runs in server process — in production use a dedicated worker or external scheduler for reliability.

- Attendance reports & low-attendance checks
   - Purpose: Aggregation pipelines compute per-student attendance percentages and optionally email students when below threshold.
   - Location: `services/reportService.js`, `utils/nodemailer.js` (email templates), and a manual trigger route can be added for on-demand generation.

- AI study recommendations (OpenRouter integration)
   - Purpose: Generate short, personalized study recommendations using the OpenRouter API (model prompts tuned in code).
   - Location: `controllers/aiController.js`, `models/Score.js` (marksheet AI remarks), and `routes/aiRoutes.js`.
   - Notes: Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in environment variables.

- json2csv (CSV export)
   - Purpose: Convert user and report JSON data into CSV for admins/downloads.
   - Location: Implemented in `controllers/authController.js` (CSV export example for users).

- Nodemailer (email sending)
   - Purpose: Send password reset links and attendance reports via Gmail SMTP or other providers.
   - Location: `utils/nodemailer.js` and usages in `controllers/authController.js` and reporting services.
   - Notes: Requires SMTP credentials in `.env` (SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS or EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASS).

- Password reset flow & archiver for attachments
   - Purpose: Password reset via time-limited JWT tokens. Archiver used to create ZIPs of marksheets for batch download.
   - Location: `controllers/authController.js` (forgot/reset password), `controllers/marksheetController.js` (PDF & ZIP export using `pdfkit` + `archiver`).

- Bcryptjs + JWT
   - Purpose: Password hashing and session/token management.
   - Location: `models/User.js` (pre-save hashing using `bcryptjs`), `controllers/authController.js` (login/jwt issuance).

- CRUD for campuses, classes, users, enrollments, assignments, exams, scores, attendance
   - Purpose: Full management endpoints for all core entities.
   - Location: See `controllers/` and `routes/` folders — most controllers and routes are scaffolded (auth, campus, class, enrollment, exam, score, attendance). Use standard RESTful patterns and validation middlewares already in place.

- Aggregation analytics & dashboard data
   - Purpose: Provide aggregate metrics for dashboards (attendance rates, top/bottom students, average scores per class, pass/fail statistics).
   - Location: `services/reportService.js` contains example aggregation queries; you can extend them into dedicated dashboard endpoints.

- Pagination & filtering
   - Purpose: Use query parameters for pagination and filtering across list endpoints (e.g., `?page=1&limit=20&role=teacher`).
   - Location: Implemented in several controllers (for example `controllers/authController.js` for users). Apply the same pattern to other list endpoints.

- PDFKit for marksheets
   - Purpose: Generate printable PDF marksheets per student and zip multiple marksheets for download.
   - Location: `controllers/marksheetController.js` (uses `pdfkit` and `archiver`).

- OpenRouter AI integration for study recommendations
   - Purpose: Short AI-generated study recommendations are created from student scores and included in marksheets or returned by endpoints.
   - Location: `config/openrouter.js`, `controllers/aiController.js`, and `models/Score.js` (AI remark generation during marksheet creation).
